## About

For this project I wanted to create a messaging app inspired by Discord. In this app, users are able to sign-up, update their profiles, manage friends through friend requests, send pictures/gifs in direct messages, reply to specific messages, and create group chats.

This project was made as part of The ODIN Project's NodeJS curriculum where the goal was to create a full-stack application. This repository comprises the frontend portion of this app.
